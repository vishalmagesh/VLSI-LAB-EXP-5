# VLSI-LAB-EXP-5
# SIMULATION AND IMPLEMENTATION OF FINITE STATE MACHINE

# AIM: To simulate and synthesis finite state machine using Xilinx ISE.

# APPARATUS REQUIRED:

Xilinx 14.7 
Spartan6 FPGA

# PROCEDURE: 
```
STEP:1 Start the Xilinx navigator, Select and Name the New project.
STEP:2 Select the device family, device, package and speed. 
STEP:3 Select new source in the New Project and select Verilog Module as the Source type. 
STEP:4 Type the File Name and Click Next and then finish button. Type the code and save it. 
STEP:5 Select the Behavioral Simulation in the Source Window and click the check syntax. 
STEP:6 Click the simulation to simulate the program and give the inputs and verify the outputs as per the truth table. 
STEP:7 Select the Implementation in the Sources Window and select the required file in the Processes Window. 
STEP:8 Select Check Syntax from the Synthesize XST Process. Double Click in the Floorplan Area/IO/Logic-Post Synthesis process in the User Constraints process group. UCF(User constraint File) is obtained. 
STEP:9 In the Design Object List Window, enter the pin location for each pin in the Loc column Select save from the File menu. 
STEP:10 Double click on the Implement Design and double click on the Generate Programming File to create a bitstream of the design.(.v) file is converted into .bit file here. 
STEP:11 On the board, by giving required input, the LEDs starts to glow light, indicating the output.
STEP:12 Load the Bit file into the SPARTAN 6 FPGA

VERILOG CODE:
```
module fsm( clk, rst, inp, outp);
input clk, rst, inp;
output outp;
reg [1:0] state;
reg outp;
always @(posedge clk, posedge rst)
begin
if(rst)
state<=2'b00;
else
begin
case(state)
2'b00:
begin
if(inp) state <=2'b01;
else state <=2'b10;
end
2'b01:
begin
if (inp) state <=2'b11;
else state<=2'b10;
end
2'b10:
begin
if (inp) state<=2'b01;
else state <=2'b11;
end
2'b11:
begin
if (inp) state <=2'b01;
else state <=2'b10;
end
endcase
end
end
always @(posedge clk, posedge rst)
begin
if(rst)
outp <= 0;
else if(state == 2'b11)
outp <= 1;
else outp<= 0;
end
endmodule
```
OUTPUT:
![322197893-5a093168-10f6-4f6c-b4f7-cdfa69e883d4](https://github.com/navaneethans/VLSI-LAB-EXP-5/assets/160302888/0c477046-0452-45f3-8b31-cf7363917ab9)


RESULT:
hence the finite state machine has been simulated and synthesised using Vivado 2023.2
